- Visualize elements of array in the form of bar graphs
- Offers a selection menu to choose various algorithms
- Offers a selection menu to choose the speed of sorting action
- Graphically show the comparisons made and swapping of elements

## Get Started

Step 1: Open a terminal/git bash

Step 2: Run the following command

```bash
[user@desktop local/path] $ git clone https://github.com/Kunal-Kumar-Sahoo/SortingVisualizer.git
